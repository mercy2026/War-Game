# War-Game
This program is a war game, that simulates a card game between a player ("Player 1") and the computer ("System").

There are 52 cards in the deck, all the cards will be split up among both players. Both players can not look at their cards, and will flipped them at the same time.

Whichever card is higher in rank will win, and the player with the highere ranking card will collect both their and your card, and put it in their deck.

Who ever is able to get all the cards in the end wins, while the player who is left with no cards loses.
